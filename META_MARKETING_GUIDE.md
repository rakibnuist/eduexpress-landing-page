# 🚀 EduExpress International: Complete Meta Marketing Guideline

This guide is designed to help you launch high-performing Facebook and Instagram ads for your Study Abroad agency. We have already set up the "Technical Foundation" (Pixel & Events) on your landing page. Now, let's build the marketing machine.

---

## ✅ Phase 1: Technical Checklist (Before You Spend $1)

Ensure these are green before launching:
1.  **Pixel Active:** Verify `ViewContent` and `CompleteRegistration` are firing using the "Meta Pixel Helper" chrome extension.
2.  **Domain Verified:** Your domain (`eduexpressint.com`) must be verified in Facebook Business Manager.
3.  **Aggregated Event Measurement:** Prioritize `CompleteRegistration` as your #1 event in Events Manager (critical for iOS14+ tracking).

## 🎯 Phase 2: Campaign Strategy (The "2-Step Funnel")

Since you are a new brand without a huge reputation yet, we will use a **Filter & Close** strategy.

### Campaign A: The "Hook" (Cold Audience)
*   **Goal:** Get cheap traffic to the landing page and let the "No IELTS" hook filter them.
*   **Objective:** **Traffic** (Optimization: Landing Page Views) OR **Leads** (Optimization: Performance goals). *Recommended: Leads (Website Conversion).*
*   **Budget:** 60% of total budget.

### Campaign B: The "Reminder" (Retargeting)
*   **Goal:** Convert people who visited but didn't apply.
*   **Objective:** **Sales / Leads** (Optimization: `CompleteRegistration` Event).
*   **Audience:** Custom Audience (Website Visitors - Last 30 Days).
*   **Budget:** 40% of total budget.

## 🛠 Phase 3: Campaign Setup Guide

### 1. Daily Budget Planning
*   **Start Small:** $10 - $20 USD / day.
*   **Split:** $12 for Cold Audience, $8 for Retargeting.
*   **Rule:** Don't touch a running ad for 3 days. Let the AI learn.

### 2. Audience Targeting (Who to show ads to?)

**Set A: The "Dreamers" (Broad Interest)**
*   **Location:** Bangladesh (Exclude extremely rural areas if you want higher paying capacity).
*   **Age:** 18 - 28 (Core student demographic).
