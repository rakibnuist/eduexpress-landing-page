# Meta Advantage+ Migration Guide
## Study in China Lead Generation - Bangladesh Market

---

## 📋 Pre-Migration Checklist

**DO NOT migrate to Advantage+ until you have ALL of these:**

- [ ] **100+ form submissions** from traditional campaigns
- [ ] **Pixel conversion data** for at least 50 `CompleteRegistration` events
- [ ] **Established baseline CPL** (you know your target is ৳160-320)
- [ ] **Lead quality data** (you know what a qualified lead looks like)
- [ ] **Top 5-10 performing creatives** identified from traditional campaigns
- [ ] **Sufficient budget** (minimum ৳50,000/day for Advantage+ to work effectively)
- [ ] **2 months of campaign data** to understand seasonality and patterns

**Expected Timeline:** Month 3 (Week 9-10)

---

## 🎯 What is Advantage+ and Why Use It?

### Traditional Campaigns (What You're Currently Running)
- Manual audience targeting (age, interests, education)
- Multiple campaigns (Awareness, Consideration, Conversion)
- Multiple ad sets per campaign
- Manual optimization and testing
- You control everything

### Advantage+ Campaigns (AI-Powered)
- Minimal targeting (just location + conversion goal)
- Single campaign structure
- Meta's AI finds your best customers automatically
- Faster optimization through machine learning
- Less manual work

### Why Switch?
✅ **Lower CPL** - Often 10-30% cheaper after learning phase  
✅ **Broader reach** - AI finds customers you didn't know existed  
✅ **Less time** - No constant monitoring needed  
✅ **Auto-optimization** - AI tests combinations automatically  

### Why NOT Switch (Yet)?
❌ **Need conversion data first** - AI learns from your past conversions  
❌ **Less control** - Can't manually target specific education levels  
❌ **Higher minimum budget** - Needs ৳50,000+/day to work well  
❌ **Learning phase** - First 2 weeks may be expensive

## 📊 Readiness Assessment

### Check Your Numbers (End of Month 2)

| Metric | Minimum Required | Your Number | Ready? |
|--------|-----------------|-------------|--------|
| Total Conversions | 100+ | _____ | ⬜ |
| Average CPL | ৳320 or below | ৳_____ | ⬜ |
| Lead Quality Rate | 70%+ | _____% | ⬜ |
| Best Creative CTR | 2%+ | _____% | ⬜ |
| Monthly Budget | ৳1,50,000+ | ৳_____ | ⬜ |

**If you checked 4/5 = READY to test**  
**If you checked 5/5 = HIGHLY READY to test**  
**If you checked less than 4 = Wait another month**

## 🚀 Migration Strategy: Hybrid Approach

**Don't shut down traditional campaigns!** Run both simultaneously for 2-4 weeks to compare.

### Budget Split (Month 3)

| Campaign Type | Daily Budget | Monthly Budget | Expected Leads | Purpose |
|--------------|--------------|----------------|----------------|---------|
| **Traditional Campaigns** | ৳1,05,000 | ৳31,50,000 | 100-150 | Proven baseline |
| **Advantage+ Test** | ৳45,000 | ৳13,50,000 | 40-60 | Test new approach |
| **Total** | ৳1,50,000 | ৳45,00,000 | 140-210 | Combined |

### Success Criteria for Advantage+ (After 2 weeks)

**Migrate MORE budget if:**
- ✅ CPL is 15%+ lower than traditional
- ✅ Lead quality rate is 65%+ (slightly lower is OK for lower CPL)
- ✅ Volume is consistent (not erratic)

**Stick with Traditional if:**
- ❌ CPL is higher than traditional
- ❌ Lead quality drops below 50%
- ❌ Too many spam/fake leads

## 🛠️ Step-by-Step: Creating Your First Advantage+ Campaign

### Step 1: Campaign Setup

1. **Go to Meta Ads Manager** → Create Campaign
2. **Choose Campaign Objective:**
   - Select: **"Sales"** (not Leads - use Sales for better optimization)
3. **Campaign Settings:**
   - Campaign Name: `Advantage+ | Study in China | Month 3 Test`
   - Turn ON: **Advantage+ Shopping Campaign** toggle
   - Special Ad Category: **None** (education is not restricted)
   - Budget: **Campaign Budget Optimization (CBO)**
   - Daily Budget: **৳45,000** ($405)

### Step 2: Ad Set Setup (Minimal Targeting)

Unlike traditional campaigns, you'll have very little to set here:

#### **Conversion Event**
- Conversion Location: **Website**
- Pixel: Your Meta Pixel
- Conversion Event: **CompleteRegistration** (form submission)

#### **Budget & Schedule**
- Already set at campaign level (৳45,000/day)
- Start: Immediately
- End: No end date (continuous)

#### **Audience**
This is where Advantage+ is VERY different:

**Location:**
- Countries: **Bangladesh**
- OR Specific Cities (Recommended for you):
  - Dhaka
  - Chittagong
  - Sylhet
  - Rajshahi
  - Khulna

**Age:**
- Option 1 (Recommended): **18-65** (let AI find best age)
- Option 2 (Safer): **18-30** (if worried about parents vs students)

**Gender:**
- **All genders** (let AI optimize)

**Detailed Targeting:**
- **Leave BLANK** - This is key! No interests, no behaviors
- Turn ON: **Advantage+ Audience** (if available)

**Existing Customers (IMPORTANT):**
- Customer List: Upload your existing leads (phone numbers from form submissions)
- Setting: **Exclude** (don't show ads to people who already submitted)

#### **Placements**
- **Advantage+ Placements** (Automatic - RECOMMENDED)
- OR Manual Placements (if you want control):
  - Facebook Feed ✅
  - Instagram Feed ✅
  - Facebook Reels ✅
  - Instagram Reels ✅
  - Facebook Marketplace ✅
  - Deselect: Audience Network (can be low quality)

### Step 3: Creative Setup

**Upload 8-10 Creative Variations:**
- Your best 5 performing images/videos from Month 1-2
- 3-5 NEW creative variations to test

**Creative Format:**
- Use: **Multiple Image/Video Ads**
- Meta will auto-test combinations

**Primary Text (Copy):**
Upload 3-5 variations of your best-performing ad copy, for example:

```

### Step 4: Publish & Monitor

- Review everything
- Click **Publish**
- Campaign will enter **Learning Phase** (needs ~50 conversions to optimize)

---

## 📈 Monitoring & Optimization (First 2 Weeks)

### Daily Checks (First 3 Days)

**Check every 12 hours:**
- Spend vs. Budget (should be on pace)
- Impressions (should be growing)
- Cost Per Result (will be high initially)
- Lead quality (manually check first 10 leads)

**Red Flags to Watch:**
- ❌ Zero conversions after ৳10,000 spend → Something is broken (check Pixel)
- ❌ CPL >৳1,000 after ৳20,000 spend → Pause and reassess
- ❌ 80%+ spam leads → Add more qualifying questions to form

### Weekly Analysis (Week 1-4)

| Metric | Traditional Campaigns | Advantage+ | Winner |
|--------|----------------------|------------|--------|
| Total Spend | ৳_____ | ৳_____ | |
| Total Leads | _____ | _____ | |
| CPL | ৳_____ | ৳_____ | |
| Lead Quality Rate | _____% | _____% | |
| Form Conversion Rate | _____% | _____% | |

**After 2 Weeks:**
- If Advantage+ is winning → Increase budget by 20%
- If Traditional is winning → Keep current split or reduce Advantage+ budget

## 🔧 Common Issues & Fixes

### Issue 1: High CPL in Learning Phase

**Expected:** CPL may be 2-3x higher for first 7-14 days  
**Solution:** 
- Wait for 50 conversions before judging
- Don't pause or change anything during learning
- Judge performance after learning phase ends

### Issue 2: Low Lead Quality (Lots of Spam)

**Cause:** AI is optimizing for volume, not quality  
**Solutions:**
1. Add qualifying questions to form (GPA, degree level)
2. Use **Value Optimization** instead of conversions (if you can track lead value)
3. Create custom conversion event for "Qualified Lead" (not just form submission)
4. Exclude low-intent placements (Audience Network)

### Issue 3: Spending Too Fast or Too Slow

**Too Fast (spending 150% of daily budget):**
- This is normal in first 2-3 days
- Meta will stabilize after learning phase

**Too Slow (spending 50% of daily budget):**
- Your bid is too low or audience is too narrow
- For Bangladesh, this is rare - likely Pixel issue
- Check: Pixel is firing, conversion events are tracking

### Issue 4: Campaign Stuck in Learning Phase

**Cause:** Not enough conversions (needs 50 in 7 days)  
**Solutions:**
- Increase budget (more budget = more delivery = more conversions)
- Reduce number of ad sets (consolidate)
- Check if Pixel events are firing correctly

## 🎯 Advanced: Advantage+ Audience Suggestions

After 2-3 weeks, if Advantage+ is performing well, you can optionally add **Audience Suggestions** to guide the AI:

### How to Add (Edit Ad Set)

1. Go to ad set settings
2. Under "Audience," find **"Advantage+ Audience"**
3. Add **Suggestions** (not requirements):

**Suggested Audiences:**
- Custom Audience: Website visitors (last 30 days)
- Lookalike Audience: 1% of form submitters
- Interest: Study abroad, scholarships

**How it Works:**
- AI will PRIORITIZE these audiences
- But will also explore beyond them
- Think of it as a "hint" not a "rule"

---

## 📊 Month 3-4: Scaling Strategy

### If Advantage+ is WINNING:

**Week 9-10: Testing Phase**
- Traditional: 70% budget (৳1,05,000/day)
- Advantage+: 30% budget (৳45,000/day)

**Week 11-12: Shift Budget**
- Traditional: 50% budget (৳75,000/day)
- Advantage+: 50% budget (৳75,000/day)

**Month 4: Scale Winner**
- If Advantage+ maintains performance:
  - Traditional: 30% (for backup/control)
  - Advantage+: 70% (primary driver)

### If Traditional is WINNING:

**Keep your current successful strategy!**
- No shame in sticking with traditional
- Bangladesh market may respond better to targeted messaging
- You have more control over quality
